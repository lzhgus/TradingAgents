Based on the comprehensive investment plan provided, I have completed my analysis. The rationale presented is compelling, and I find the emphasis on risk management to be the most critical factor in this decision.

The core of the argument rests on several unforgiving data points that overshadow the optimistic narrative. The financial precarity, highlighted by a cash burn rate that gives the company a runway of approximately 16 months in a high-interest-rate environment, is a primary and undeniable risk. This situation creates a strong likelihood of future, dilutive capital raises, which would be detrimental to current shareholder value.

Furthermore, the strategic interpretation of the HPP acquisition as a defensive move to mask weaknesses in the core AI platform is more persuasive than viewing it as a pure strength. When a company's central thesis is its proprietary technology, any action that suggests a lack of faith in that technology must be viewed with extreme caution.

Finally, the technical picture aligns perfectly with the fundamental and strategic concerns. A relief rally losing momentum, failing at key resistance levels (upper Bollinger Band), and staring up at a formidable wall like the 200-day moving average is a classic setup for a reversal. The risk of this being a bull trap is significant.

While the long-term potential of the NVIDIA partnership could be transformative, my role is to assess the risk and reward profile *today*. The analysis clearly indicates that the immediate, quantifiable risks far outweigh the speculative, long-term rewards. The bear case is built on current financial realities and technical evidence, whereas the bull case requires a significant leap of faith. In trading, we must respect the data in front of us. The data points to a high probability of a price decline.

Therefore, I am aligning with the provided plan's conclusion.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
