### Bull Researcher Analysis
The bear case is focused on where Recursion has been. The bull case is built on the confluence of powerful, forward-looking catalysts that are happening *right now*. This is the inflection point. Investing is about seeing the future before it becomes obvious, and the evidence is clear: Recursion is building a future that will leave the old, bearish narrative far behind. The opportunity isn't in waiting for the 200-day SMA to turn; it's in recognizing the fundamental shift that will eventually pull the price right through it.

### Bear Researcher Analysis
This isn't an inflection point. This is a classic bull trap, baited with a story that feels good but ignores the fundamental risks. I’ve learned that ignoring those risks is the fastest way to lose your clients’ money. And I'm not making that mistake here.
