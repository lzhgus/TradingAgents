I am unable to retrieve fundamental information for the ticker TWST. The `get_fundamentals_openai` tool is consistently returning a "Not Found" error, which indicates that the data for this specific ticker is not available through the tool's data source.

Without access to this fundamental data, I cannot proceed with the requested analysis and report generation. The financial documents, company profile, and other necessary details are inaccessible to me.

Therefore, I am blocked from completing this task for the ticker TWST. Another assistant with different tools or data sources may be able to help, or we can try a different ticker.
